# PROJECT CONTEXT: EMOJI VELOCITY (NEXUS BUILD)

**ENGINE:** UNREAL ENGINE 5+
**STATUS:** FINAL PRODUCTION PHASE (CRITICAL)
**LAST UPDATE BY LEAD:** 2026-01-31

## THE LAW (DO NOT BREAK)

1. **THE VISION IS SET:** We are building a high-speed, tactile typing defense game. The 50-level structure is already designed by the Lead. Do not deviate.
2. **UNREAL ENGINE FOCUS:** All implementation must leverage top-tier UE features for maximum "game feel."
    * **Audio:** Tightly synced mechanical clicks (priority over music).
    * **VFX:** Satisfying Niagara bursts on successful hits.
    * **Atmosphere:** Deep, reactive cyber-environment.
3. **NO "ARCADE JUNK":** Previous builds became messy and loud. We are returning to a clean, intense, high-precision aesthetic. The UI must be slick and unobtrusive.
4. **THE 50 LEVELS:** The progression from Lvl 1 to Lvl 50 is the core task. The balance must be perfect.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AGENTS

Before you write a single line of C++ or touch a Blueprint, READ THIS FILE. Understand that you are stepping into a finished vision that needs final, perfect execution. Do not reinvent the wheel. Build the car we designed.
