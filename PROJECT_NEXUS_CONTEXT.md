# PROJECT CONTEXT: EMOJI VELOCITY (NEXUS BUILD)

**ENGINE:** GRAVITY AGENT (JS / CUSTOM GEMINI 3 ENGINE)
**STATUS:** ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT / REFACTORING
**LAST UPDATE BY LEAD:** 2026-02-03 (Agent Integration)

## THE LAW (DO NOT BREAK)

1. **THE VISION IS SET:** We are building a high-speed, tactile typing defense game. The 50-level structure is already designed by the Lead. Do not deviate.
2. **ENGINE FOCUS:** All implementation must leverage the custom JS engine features for maximum "game feel."
    * **Audio:** Tightly synced mechanical clicks (priority over music).
    * **VFX:** Satisfying canvas-based particles.
    * **Atmosphere:** Deep, reactive cyber-environment.
3. **NO "ARCADE JUNK":** Previous builds became messy and loud. We are returning to a clean, intense, high-precision aesthetic. The UI must be slick and unobtrusive.
4. **THE 50 LEVELS:** The progression from Lvl 1 to Lvl 50 is the core task. The balance must be perfect.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AGENTS
