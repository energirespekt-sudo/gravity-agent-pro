**STATUS:** ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
**LAST UPDATE:** 2026-01-31

## CORE DIRECTIVES (DO NOT IGNORE)

1. **NO CODDLING:** The user wants direct, high-level technical execution. No apologies. No hesitation.
2. **SCALE:** This project involves 16 agents, a security ecosystem, hardware integration (Mouse), and a core App.
3. **CURRENT SPRINT:** Finalizing the 50-level game loop.

## GAME STATE

- **Levels:** 50 levels designed.
- **Priorities:**
  - **Graphics:** Must be consistent and high-quality.
  - **Balance:** Difficulty curve must be smooth across all 50 levels.
  - **Game Feel:** Controls must be tight. Physics must feel "right" (Gravity Agents style).

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION

Before writing code, ALWAYS reference this file to understand the scale of what has already been built. We are not starting from scratch; we are finishing a massive journey.
