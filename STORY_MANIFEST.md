# GRAVITY AGENT: STORY & VARIETY MANIFEST

## The Vision

This document awaits the User's Storyline. It will serve as the blueprint for:

1. **Level Progression:** How the game evolves from Level 1 to Boss 2 and beyond.
2. **Gameplay Variety:** Switching mechanics (e.g., Falling Words -> Side-Scrolling Ships -> Boss Typers).
3. **Narrative:** The dialogue and reasons *why* the Agent is fighting.

## Draft Area (User Input Goes Here)

* **Chapter 1 (City Grid):** (Current)
* **Chapter 2 (Space/Travel):** ???
* **The Architect (Boss):** ???

## Technical Needs (Antigravity Notes)

- Need to refactor `SpawningSystem` to support `direction` (Top-Down vs Left-Right).
* Need `LevelManager` to switch background/music/enemies based on Story Chapter.
